import random

#1. Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World")
#2. Create a list with three variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 100
list1 = [random.randint(1,100), random.randint(1,100), random.randint(1,100)]
#3. Print the list.
print(list1)
#4. Create an if statement that determines which of the three numbers is the highest and prints the result.
if list1[0] > list1[1] and list1[0] > list1[2]:
    print("The first number is the greatest number")
    num = list1[0]
elif list1[1] > list1[0] and list1[1] > list1[2]:
    print("The second number is the greatest number")
    num = list1[1]
elif list1[2] > list1[0] and list1[2] > list1[1]:
    print("The third number is the greatest number")
    num = list1[2]
#5. Tie the result (the largest number) from #4 to a variable called "num".
print(num)
#6. Create a nested if statement that prints if num is divisible by 2, divisible by 3, both, or neither.
if num % 2 == 0:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        print("divisible by both")
    else:
        print("divisible by two")
else:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        print("divisible by 3")
    else:
        print("divisible by none")
