    "taco" : "sauce",
    "happy" : "sad",
    "number" : [1, 2, 3]
}
#3. Print the keys of the dictionary from #2.
print(dictionary1.keys())
#4. Print the values of the dictionary from #2
print(dictionary1.values())
#5. Print one of the three numbers from the list by itself
print(dictionary1["number"][0])
#6. Using the update function, add a fourth key to the dictionary and give it a value.
dictionary1.update({"cool" : 'yay'})
#7. Print the entire dictionary from #2 with the updated key and value.
print(dictionary1)
#8. Make a nested dictionary with three entries containing the name of another classmate and two other pieces of information

        'age' : 14,
        'grade' : '9th',
    }
}
#9. Print the names of all three classmates on the same line.
print(Students1['Student1']['name'], Students1['Student2']['name'], Students1['Student3']['name'])
